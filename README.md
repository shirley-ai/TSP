# TSP
Heuristics is a powerful approach to optimisation problem. When facing really complex problems, optimal solution approached by Mathematical programming can be too costly or not realistic. Heuristics provides a near-optimal solution with low cost and high effciency.

This is to develop and optimise various heuristics algorithms in MATLAB to solve Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP), including Meta-heuristics (both pure and hybrid) and Hyper-heuristics. All cases used in the project are standard TSP instances.
